<!-- 👨‍💻 -->

<!-- Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Python-powered **Web Developer** exploring the boundaries of backend, AI, and automation. Here you'll find personal projects, research ideas, experiments — and a few anime-inspired tech creations that reflect how I learn and build. -->

**Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!**

I'm a *Web Developer* with a strong foundation in *Python*, passionate about building powerful backend systems and pushing the limits of what's possible with AI, automation, and creative coding. This space is a reflection of my learning journey — a mix of personal projects, research-driven ideas, and experimental code. You'll also notice a touch of my personality in the form of anime-inspired tech creations, blending art and logic in fun, unconventional ways. Whether you're here to collaborate, browse, or just curious, I hope you'll find something interesting in my work!

### 🚀 Highlights

- 🤖 **Bots & Automation:** From Discord bots like `Synthia` to GitHub automation like `LumaBot` — I build tools that interact, thank, and automate with charm.

- 🕸️ **Web Dev:** Functional and dynamic APIs built with Django, Flask, and FastAPI — always backend-first, always minimal.

- 🧪 **AI Research:** A research initiative combining LSTM + CNN models to analyze imbalanced data and detect advanced persistent threats.

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

<!-- Whether you're building tools, researching security, or just want to nerd out over anime-themed bots — I’m always up for conversations and collabs. -->

I'm creating mascot-driven developer tools — bots and apps with anime-style personalities.
Many mascots were initially prototyped with AI, but I'd love to bring them to life with real collaborators!

🧩 Looking for:

  -  🎨 Artists for character designs

  -  💻 Developers into bots & backend

  -  ✍️ Writers for dialog and style
