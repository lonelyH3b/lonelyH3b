Hi ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Rakin, a passionate and curious software developer with a strong foundation in Java and a growing interest in JavaScript. Over the years, I've honed my skills in problem-solving through platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank and Kaggle, where I enjoy tackling challenging algorithms and data structure problems. My journey in the tech world has also led me to explore various technologies, like Selenium and JMeter.

I thrive in fast-paced environments and am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow. Currently, I'm diving deeper into front-end development with Vue.js and Jekyll, eager to expand my expertise and create impactful digital experiences.

Beyond code, Iâ€™m a firm believer in continuous learning and self-improvement. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for new challenges that can push me out of my comfort zone and help me evolve as a developer and as an individual.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, engaging in light-hearted conversations, or simply enjoying a moment of creativity.
